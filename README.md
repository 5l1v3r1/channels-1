![Channels](internals/img/repo-banner.png)

## About

Channels, began as a 3 week, final project at a coding bootcamp. Since then, in an effort to gain a better understanding of React and Redux, I've completely rewritten the 3 week app. The rewrite includes some great new tooling and libraries such as: Flow, ESLint, and Jest.

## Download

You can download Channels for **free** from the GitHub repository [releases](https://github.com/BuckyMaler/channels/releases) page.
